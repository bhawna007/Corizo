        <tr>
            <td>Scope</td>
            <td>let is block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block {} in which it is declared.</td>
            <td>var is function-scoped, meaning it is accessible within the function where it is declared. If declared outside a function, it becomes globally scoped.</td>
            <td> Like let, const is block-scoped.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Hoisting</td>
            <td>let is also hoisted, but unlike var, it is not initialized with undefined. Accessing it before declaration results in a ReferenceError due to the temporal dead zone (TDZ).</td>
            <td> Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope, meaning the declaration is moved to the top during the compile phase, but not the initialization.</td>
            <td>const behaves similarly to let in terms of hoisting and the temporal dead zone.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Reassignment and Redeclaration</td>
            <td>You can reassign a let variable, but you cannot redeclare it in the same scope.</td>
            <td> You can reassign and redeclare a var variable within the same scope.</td>
            <td> const is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned. The variable itself cannot be reassigned, but if it is an object or array, the contents can be modified.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Example</td>
            <td><pre>function example() {
                console.log(y); // ReferenceError: 
                Cannot access 'y' before initialization
                let y = 20;
                console.log(y); // 20
            }
            example();</pre></td>
            <td><pre>function example() {
                console.log(x); // undefined 
                (due to hoisting)
                var x = 10;
                console.log(x); // 10
            }
